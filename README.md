Spatial-Temporal Data Mining for House Transactions.

The purpose of the research is using the raw data and data-mining skills, such as LASSO(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), to create a system that takes features of houses as input and prediction of the house price as the response.
In the research, Python is used to gather and clean data, and Matlab is used to do data- mining. LASSO, least-squares normal equations, and cross validation are the main methods to get the final results. The model is generated based on 2000 houses information and the test data is 300 houses information. All the original data is provided by the supervisor. After testing the model on the test data, the accuracy to predict the house price can reach 91.22%.
